    # This function displays all the courses, indicates which ones
    # in which the student is enrolled, and counts the courses a
    # student has registered for. It has two parameters: s_id is the
    # ID of the student; c_roster is the list of class rosters.
    # This function has no return value.

    # This function adds a student to a course.  It has three
    # parameters: s_id is the ID of the student to be added; c_roster is the
    # list of class rosters; c_max_size is the list of maximum class sizes.
    # This function asks user to enter the course he/she wants to add.
    # If the course is not offered, display error message and stop.
    # If student has already registered for this course, display
    # error message and stop.
    # If the course is full, display error message and stop.
    # If everything is okay, add student ID to the courseâ€™s
    # roster and display a message if there is no problem.  This
    # function has no return value.
